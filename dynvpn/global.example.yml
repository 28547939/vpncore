# numeric vs "dynvpn" IDs
# all VPNs are named "dynvpnN" where N is some numeric ID greater than 0
# so the numeric ID uniquely identifies the VPN, but we still use the "dynvpn" prefix
#   for clarity/readability and for situations where a non-numeric ID is needed 
#   (like jail names)


# to configure a VPN for failover, list it here with its priority list of site IDs
# VPNs which are not listed here will not participate in any failover logic (see README)
#
# but, note that it's not possible to bring the same VPN online on two hosts: an Online VPN will
#   switch to Offline if it learns of another host bringing that VPN to Online

# in addition to the assumption that all VPN names begin with "dynvpn", we assume that
# a VPN's numeric ID corresponds to its (container's) IP addresses.
#
# all VPNs have an anycast address and a local address, and these are calculated from a "base"
#   IP address value by just adding the numeric ID to the base.
# in the future, if it proves useful, this constraint can be eliminated, potentially at the expense
#   of a more verbose configuration
#
# in this example, dynvpn0 will have address 10.0.0.50, dynvpn1 will have 10.0.0.51, and so on
# currently the arithmetic will "wrap around", so 10.0.0.50 for vpn ID 56 is 10.0.2.0
